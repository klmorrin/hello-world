Describe your own initial understandings and assumptions about "technical writing" as you start the course. How do your initial understandings/assumptions align (or not) with the work we have done so far? 

My initial understandings and assumptions about “technical writing” mostly aligned with the work we have done so far. I saw technical writing as writing that you use to explain or demonstrate something. What I was not expecting was to learn that game design and posts on social media are parts of technical writing. It makes sense now that we have had a discussion about it but at first I was surprised. 

Reflect on your experience in composing these instruction sets -- attempt to describe all of the choices you made in the process of realizing your composition. In light of our usability testing -- what, if anything, would you revise or change about your instruction set in order to improve it? 

When composing that instruction set I first decided that I would use a random assortment of legos and see what could be built with them. Before I even made a creation I itemized the legos on one page of my instructions. After I did this I started to build and write the instructions at the same time. I chose to hand write my instruction set because I did not how to do it in any other way. After doing usability testing with a couple of the other students I was able to see different ways of using pictures (taken with cell phones) and power point presentations.  

In order to improve on my instruction set I would attempt to use pictures instead of illustrations and I would also make some of my wording a bit more clear.  
 

Technical Writing -- like any field or category of writing -- is rhetorically situated. That means that questions of audience are essential considerations to what's produced. Even though this is a classroom exercise -- what sense of audience for these instructions do you have? How, if at all, has this sense of audience -- that you are designing this text for a reader -- informed the choices you made in producing the composition? 

I did not have a sense of audience before I started making my instructions. That is an area that I need to work on in the future. If I would have taken my audience into consideration and had more knowledge about computer systems I would have chosen a different medium.  

I have left it up to you as to how you deliver your instructional text to your audience. You could choose Word, PowerPoint, HTML or any number of mediums or platforms. How did you decide to deliver your composition and what factors motivated that choice? Ultimately, what do you think your choice of delivery medium/platform get you as a writer? 

I decided to deliver my composition in written form because it was the easiest for me and I felt the most comfortable. In the future, however, I will attempt to target the audience more. For this activity I think that it worked handwritten but I can make improvements in the future. 

Describe and reflect on your work in setting up an account and repository on GitHub. The "Hello World" tutorial/guide on GitHub is an example of tech writing. What did you notice about it? Perhaps more importantly, what might you learn from it? What's at least one thing you might take away from the GitHub "Hello World" tutorial that you could apply to your own instructional set in order to improve it? 

I noticed that there were words and pictures/videos for every step. When I was confused about the written instructions I was able to look at the pictures/ videos to get a clearer idea of what I was supposed to do! I learned that using a couple different learning styles to give instructions can accommodate a larger group of people. I could use this method in my own instructional set my creating a video if there are any points that are confusing. 

Finally, what do you think you learned this week? Keep in mind that your learning might resonate with particular course outcomes or personal outcomes or even something unexpected or not entirely anticipated by either articualted course or personal outcomes. 

I learned that I have a lot to learn when it comes to technology. In order for my work/ products to be usable for my audience I need to break out of my non-technology shell and learn how to use different types of platforms that use computers and internet.
